/* STEP 1: Creating an array
When declaring and initializing an array, you can include strings, numbers, booleans, and even other arrays */
let myArray = ["string", true, 100, [5, "hello", false]];

/* STEP 2: Reading and changing array elements
You can refer to a particular element in an array with it's index number */
output.textContent = `The first element in myArray is ${myArray[2]}.`;
// You can also change a particular element
myArray[1] = false;
output.textContent = `The second element in myArray is ${myArray[1]}.`;

// An array within an array is called a multidimensional array - it can be accessed by specifying the index of the first array, then the item within it
output.textContent = `The second element withing the fourth element in myArray is ${myArray[3][1]}.`;

/* STEP 3: Determining array length
Being able to figure out how many elements are contained in an array is a critical feature of JavaScript programming */
output.textContent = `There are ${myArray[3].length} items in the array inside the myArray array.`;
output.textContent = "";
// In particular, looping through arrays
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i ++ ) {
    // Check if array element is an array
    // if (typeof(myArray[i]) === "object") {
    if (Array.isArray(myArray[i])) {
        // We have an array! So let's build a loop
        for (let j = 0; j < myArray[i].length; j ++) {
            output.textContent += `${myArray[i][j]}, `;
        };
    } else {
        output.textContent += `${myArray[i]}, `;
    };
};

/* STEP 4: Convert a string to an array
If there is a common character that can act as a delimiter in a string, we can use this character to create an array */
let orig6 = `Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers`;
let orig6Array = orig6.split(", ");
// Output one of the array items
output.textContent = orig6Array[2];
// Output the last element of the array
output.textContent = orig6Array[orig6Array.length - 1];
/* STEP 5: Convert an array back to a string
Use join() and toString() - note that join() allows you to choose and insert a delimiter, while toString() does not */
// let orig6String = orig6Array.toString();
let orig6String = orig6Array.join(" | ");

output.textContent = orig6String;
/* STEP 6: Adding and removing items from an array
Without the ability to edit the contents of an array, this type of variable would have limited use - but adding and removing array items is pretty straightforward */

// Adding one or more items to an array with push()
// orig6Array.push("Buffalo Sabres");

// If you would like to capture how many elements are in the array after you have edited it, then…
let orig6Length = orig6Array.push("Buffalo Sabres", "Philadelphia Flyers");

// Removing an item from an array with pop()
let removedItem = orig6Array.pop();

// pop() returns the item that was removed, rather than the length of the updated array, so…

// To do the same thing, that is, to add and remove an item from the beginning of the array, use shift() and unshift()
orig6Length = orig6Array.unshift("Winnipeg Jets");
removedItem = orig6Array.shift();
// We can also modify the array contents by deleting or substituting elements, or inserting one or more elements at a certain place with splice()
orig6Array.splice(2, 2, "Edmonton Oilers");
/* That's it for the basics of working with arrays! With these tools at your disposal, a whole new world of possibilities with JavaScript are at your command */
